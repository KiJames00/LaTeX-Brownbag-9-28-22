# LaTeX-Brownbag-9-28-22
The code for the "Introduction to LaTeX Brownbag" presented on 9/28/22

Many examples are taken from other works, but are not cited. This is because I am a bad researcher, and I should be ashamed.

A bigger, better, more full version of the document is in the works, and should be completed over the winter break. It will almost certainly get its own repo, though.

I've included John Frampton's guide here too so that you don't have to scavenge it from some random university webpage. 

I hope this helps anybody who needs it get started!
