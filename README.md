# LaTeX-Brownbag-9-28-22
The code for the "Introduction to LaTeX Brownbag" presented on 9/28/22

Many examples are taken from other works, but are not cited. This is because I am a bad researcher, and I should be ashamed.

A bigger, better, more full version of the document is in the works, and should be completed over the winter break. It will almost certainly get its own repo, though.

I hope this helps anybody who needs it get started!
